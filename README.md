# An F1 Stats Dashboard

A small project I've been undertaking to improve my understanding and skills in React. 
The objective of this project is to have a single place to view and analyse the stats and standings of F1 races - both current and historic. 

This program currently relies on the (Ergast API)[http://ergast.com/mrd/methods/results/], although this will be deprecated in 2024 - I am considering creating a custom backend for it in the near future. 

## Component Library
This project uses MUI v5 for its custom components. More information can be found here: https://mui.com
